# Project-Smart-Brain
The goal of this project is to detect and locate human faces in a color image.
The first level of the website is ‘User authentication’ i.e. if the user is new to the website, then he/she will have to create an account first. The extensive use of Database Management System will handle this case. 
After ‘User authentication’ the user will be directed to the next level of the website i.e. the page where all the magic will happen. In this page there will be a search-bar where the user will input the ‘url’ of the image of his/her desire. Besides the search-bar is the detect button which on pressing will detect all the faces in the image.
There will be an implementation of a ‘rank’ system where the user will be assigned a rank on the basis of number of images he/she puts in the search-bar for detection.
